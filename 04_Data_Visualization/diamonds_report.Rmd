# Hello World

This is markdown language. Today we learn a few topics in R.

- databases
- working with date
- ggplot2
- rmarkdown

## Homework

Explore dataframe 'diamonds' and create 5 visualizations.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(diamonds)
```

### Chart 1 - Relationship between carat and price

Cut quality is used as a color variable. First, I will find the correlation between carat and price.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cor(diamonds$price, diamonds$carat)

set.seed(24)
ggplot(diamonds %>% sample_n(5000),
       aes(carat, price, col=cut)) +
  geom_point(size=1, alpha=0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", size=1) +
  facet_wrap(~color, ncol=3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Carat",
    y = "Price USD",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds ggplot2"
  )
```

We found a positive relationship between two variables - the greater the carat weight, the higher the price. The most dramatic increase can be seen in ideal and very good cut diamonds.

### Chart 2: Proportion of color grades for each cut quality

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(cut, fill=color)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Proportion",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds ggplot2"
  ) 
```

Overall, diamonds in the color range D, I and J account for the smallest percentage with color J as the rarest group.

### Chart 3: Distribution of colors and cut quality

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(cut, fill = color)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Count",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds ggplot2"
  ) 
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cut_color <- count(diamonds, cut, color)

cut_color[cut_color$n == (min(cut_color$n)) |
          cut_color$n == (max(cut_color$n)), ]
```

It can be seen that fair-cut, J-color is the smallest group (119 diamonds) while the figure for ideal-cut, G-color is the largest proportion at just under 5,000 diamonds.

### Chart 4: Price distribution of diamonds

Comparing one-carat diamonds

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
diamonds_one_carat <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat == 1)

diamonds_one_carat %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    min = min(price),
    max = max(price)
  )

ggplot(diamonds_one_carat, aes(price)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = stat(count) >= 145), bins = 30, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(`TRUE` = "purple4", `FALSE` = alpha("gray", 0.7))) +
  stat_bin(
    geom ="text", 
    aes(label = after_stat(if_else (condition = count>= 145, as.character(count), ""))), 
    vjust = -.5) + 
  geom_rug() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Price USD",
    y = "Count",
    subtitle = "Price distribution of one-carat diamonds"
  )
```

The price of one-carat diamond ranges from $1,681 to $16,469. Approximately 65% of the diamonds cost between $3,750 and $6,250. 

### Chart 5: Average price of diamonds for each clarity

Comparing one-carat diamonds

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds_one_carat, aes(price, clarity, col=clarity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Price USD",
    y = "Clarity",
    subtitle = "Avarage price for each clarity",
    caption = "Data source: diamonds ggplot2"
  )
```

It can be seen from the box plots that price increases markedly with the clarity scale.

*IF stands for 'Internally Flawless', therefore it is the best grade in this dataset. I1 stands for 'Included' which is the lowest quality.
